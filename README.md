Data Preparation, Statistical Reasoning and Machine Learning: Predicting Credit Card Risk

**Challenge Overview 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The purpose of this project is to apply supervised machine learning algorithms to determine credit card risk. It is in the best interest of financial institutions, banks, and peer to peer lending firms to automate and improve the accuracy of detecting high risk individuals, prior to granting loans to assure minimal default. 
With machine learning , it is particularly challenging due to imbalanced distribution of risk classification(low risk vs high risk), as in a given sample dataset, there are substantially more low-risk applicants than low-risk.

To due to the difficulty of screening for fewer high-risk applicants, it is beneficial to deploy various ML models, that reduce bias and resample datasets to determine the best methodology or algorithm to accurately predict credit card risk. We look into six different models.
